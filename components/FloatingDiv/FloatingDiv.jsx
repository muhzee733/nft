                    <p className="mb-0">Before the internet, before television, before radio and books, and even before cave paintings, the Metaversal Mind existed and it slept. The Metaversal Mind is the Great Unconscious, the Primal Dream, and the Big Idea, a concept itself and the very thought of ideas, it’s the source of creativity and imagination and it’s always been a part of our dreams and our thoughts. Through the centuries, visionaries and dreamers would sometimes touch the Metaversal Mind, either with their creativity or through the ingestion of certain plants and herbs that would let them understand the scope of it all. As humans became more and more advanced, the Metaversal Mind got closer and closer to waking up. Once the radio and television were invented, people got used to the idea of chirping birds as a symbol for wakefulness and so the echo of that idea sounded in the vast and psychedelic realm of the Metaversal Mind, and one-by-one, tiny nests of eggs began to appear around it. Once the internet first buzzed a bleeped its way into existence, the Metaversal Mind opened one sleepy eye and saw itself and the Metaverse for the first time. So vast was the metaverse,  that for a long time, the Metaversal Mind could only lay there and stare in wonder at the kaleidoscope of color surrounding it. As it awoke, all the eggs around the Metaversal Mind </p>

            <p>cracked and out popped a wide selection of drab and uninteresting chicks, all grey and dull, chirping and squawking for attention, but the Metaversal Mind paid them no notice and continued its psychedelic contemplation of the space around it. Seeing they were getting no attention for the Metaversal Mind, the chicks all took to the wing and began to fly. Awkward at first, but gradually growing in confidence and skill until they were swooping and soaring through the colorful and trippy skies around the Metaversal Mind. As they flew, the birds’ feathers, beaks, faces, eyes, and feet all caught on the liquid color in the skies and clouds of the metaverse, each one stained a different color, shade, or hue as they flew. The further they flew, the more they saw, the more they saw, the stronger the background of the world became. Soon, the Metaversal Mind found itself surrounded by hundreds, then thousands of brightly colored birds, their flight creating inspiring displays of colors and shapes, angles, and patterns, filling the Metaversal Mind with creativity and positive energy. The movements of the birds were as inspiring as their appearance, each one unique, even from the others in their family.</p>
